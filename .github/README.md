# ToontownJSON
ToontownJSON is a JSON schema and dataset for Toontown Online Cogs and Toons. It intends to separate the assets from their implementation details, so that custom assets can be added without strictly following undocumented and arbitrary model configuration.

It is developed alongside [Toontown Utils](https://github.com/demiurgeQuantified/toontownutils), a Panda3D package that can create Cog/Toon actors from the data.
